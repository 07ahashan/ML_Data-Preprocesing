# ML Data Preprocessing

Working on the project of machine learning has various processes involves:
1. Collection of good and understand data.
2. After the dataset received, the first ane for-most things that need to be done is that DATA PREPROCESSING.

Data Preprocessing has to be done in so efficient and organised manner that the model build on it should work efficiently and give good accuracy.
